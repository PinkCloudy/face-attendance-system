IoT-Based Face Recognition Attendance SystemInstitution: School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (SEEE) - Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) 
Project Type: Embedded Systems & Computer Vision Project📋 Executive SummaryThis project presents a cost-effective, scalable Smart Face Attendance System designed for modern office environments ("Smart Office"). Addressing the sanitary and security limitations of traditional RFID and fingerprint systems, this solution leverages a distributed IoT Client-Server architecture.The system integrates an ESP32-based embedded client running FreeRTOS for efficient edge control and a central server utilizing the InsightFace (ArcFace) deep learning model for high-precision biometric recognition. The result is a robust system capable of real-time identification with an accuracy exceeding 99% under ideal conditions.🏗 System ArchitectureThe system is designed as a hybrid model to optimize cost and performance:The Client (Edge Node):Hardware: ESP32-DevKit V1 and ESP32-CAM (OV2640 Sensor).Role: Image acquisition, video streaming, peripheral control (Servo, OLED), and power management via Deep Sleep.OS: FreeRTOS is implemented to manage multi-threading (HTTP Server task vs. Control Logic task), ensuring a control latency of <2ms.The Server (Processing Node):Hardware: PC/Workstation.Role: Heavy-lifting AI inference (Face Detection & Recognition), database management, and hosting the Web Dashboard.Communication: Data is transmitted via HTTP/WebSocket over a local WiFi network.🛠 Tech StackHardware ComponentsComponentSpecificationFunctionMCUESP32-DevKit V1Central processing unit for the client.Camera ModuleESP32-CAM (OV2640)Image capture and MJPEG streaming.DisplayOLED 0.96" (SSD1306)I2C status visualization (IP, User Name).ActuatorServo SG90Simulates door lock mechanism.SensorPIR HC-SR501Motion detection and Deep Sleep wake-up trigger.Power12V Adapter + LM2596Stable power supply preventing brownout resets.Software & AlgorithmsEmbedded Firmware: C/C++ (ESP-IDF/Arduino Core), FreeRTOS.Server Application: Python 3.x, Streamlit (Web Interface).Computer Vision: OpenCV.Deep Learning Model: InsightFace (ArcFace).Reason for selection: Comparative testing showed InsightFace outperformed Dlib/HOG in handling head poses >45° and low-light conditions.Database: SQLite/MySQL.🚀 Key FeaturesHigh-Performance Recognition: Achieves 99.83% accuracy using the ArcFace loss function, significantly reducing False Rejection Rates compared to Euclidean-based methods.Real-Time Operation:Client Latency: < 2ms (via FreeRTOS task scheduling).End-to-End Response Time: < 5 seconds.Energy Efficiency: Implements Deep Sleep mode (consuming ~5µA), activated by external PIR interrupts when no motion is detected.Web Management Dashboard: Allows administrators to view live streams, manage personnel databases, and review time-stamped attendance logs.📊 Performance EvaluationWe conducted rigorous testing to validate the system's robustness:MetricFace Recognition (Dlib)InsightFace (ArcFace)Detection AlgorithmHOG (CPU) / CNNSCRFDVector Dimension128-D512-DHead Pose Tolerance< 30°> 45° (Robust)Accuracy (Ideal)99.38%99.83%Failure Rate (Tested)23.33%3.33%Data source: Experimental results on a dataset of 30 samples.🔧 Installation & Setup1.
